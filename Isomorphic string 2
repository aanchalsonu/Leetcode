Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of 
characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
Output: false
Example 3:

Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
Output: true
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
t.length == s.length




class Solution {
public:
    bool isIsomorphic(string s, string t) {

        vector<int> freq1(128, -1);
        vector<int> freq2(128, -1);

        for(int i = 0; i<s.size(); i++){
            if(freq1[s[i]] != freq2[t[i]]){
                return false;
            }

            freq1[s[i]] = i;
            freq2[t[i]] = i;
        }

        return true;



    }

};
s and t consist of any valid ascii character.
