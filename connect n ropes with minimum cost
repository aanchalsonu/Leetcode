Given n ropes of different lengths we need to connect them into one
Cost to connect 2 ropes is the sum of their lengths
we need to find the minimum cost




int minCost(int arr[], int n)
{
	/*Write your code here. 
	 *Don't write main().
	 *Don't take input, it is passed as function argument.
	 *Don't print output.
	 *Taking input and printing output is handled automatically.
	*/

	priority_queue<int, vector<int> , greater<int>> pq;

	for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
	{
		pq.push(arr[i]);
	} 

	int cost=0,sum=0;
	while(pq.size() > 1)
	{
		int a = pq.top();
		pq.pop();
		int b = pq.top();
		pq.pop();

		sum = a+b;
		cost += sum;
		pq.push(sum);
		
	}
	return cost;
