Problem statement

Return the number of undorected grsphs that can be formed from N vertices


Sample Input 1:
3
Sample Output 1:
8   
Explanation of sample output 1:
For ‘N’ = 3,
Consider the vertices to be ‘A’, ’B’ and ‘C’.
These are the possible 8 graphs.

Sample Input 2:
5
Sample Output 2:
1024
Constraints:
1 <= ‘N’ <= 8


#include<bits/stdc++.h>

int countingGraphs(int n)
{
    // Write your code here.
    int res =0;
    res = pow(2,(n*(n-1)/2));
    return res;
}
