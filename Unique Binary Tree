Problem statement

Given a pair of tree traversal return true if a unique binary tree can be constructed else return false

Sample Input 1:
1 2
Sample Output 1:
True 
Explanation of sample output 1:
For 'a' = 1, ‘b’ = 2.

Answer is True.

It is possible to construct a unique binary tree. This is because the preorder traversal provides the root of the tree, and the inorder traversal helps determine the left and right subtrees.
Sample Input 2:
2 2
Sample Output 2:
False
Constraints:
1 <= ‘a’, ‘b’ <= 3



int uniqueBinaryTree(int a, int b){
    // Write your code here.
    return ((a==2 || b==2) && a!= b);
}
