/*

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at 
this place are arranged in a circle. That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security 
system connected, and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,3,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2), because they are adjacent houses.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: 3

FIRST CALCULATE THE ANS FOR ALL EVEN INDEXES WITH CARE THAT IT DOESNT REACH THE END WHERE IT WILL BECOME THE NEIGHBOUR OF 1ST NODE THEN CALCULATE THE ANS FOR ODD INDEXES
NOW FIND THE MAXIMUM AMOUG THESE 2
